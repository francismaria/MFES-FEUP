# MFES-FEUP
Repository to host a project created during MFES couse @ FEUP.

## Goal

The goal of this practical work was to develop, test and document an executable formal model of a high integrity software system in VDM++ using the Overture tool or the VDMTools. 

## Description

The project theme was to create a collaborative community that interconnects people, retailers, and brands. Ratings & Reviews, sales boost and key shopper data. Users have the opportunity to find information about your products (ratings and reviews, composition, ...), and also to participate in various competitions and missions offered by your brands.

As stated above the model was created using the Overture tool. However, it was also necessary to have an interface to interact with the code generated from the model, therefore I created a simple GUI in java Swing which is similar to a simple online shop interface.

## Gains

At the end of the work, I have acquired the ability of formally modeling software systems in VDM++, and to demonstrate the consistency of a model.

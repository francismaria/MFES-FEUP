# MFES-FEUP
Repository to host a project created during MFES couse @ FEUP.

## Goal

The goal of this practical work was to develop, test and document an executable formal model of a high integrity software system in VDM++ using the Overture tool or the VDMTools. 

## Description

As stated above the model was created using the Overture tool. However, it was also necessary to have an interface to interact with the code generated from the model. I created a simple GUI in java Swing which is similar to a simple shop interface.

## Gains

At the end of the work, I have acquired the ability of formally modeling software systems in VDM++, and of demonstrating the consistency of the model.
